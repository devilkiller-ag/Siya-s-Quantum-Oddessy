        <h2>Pre-Build Review</h2>
        <li> Try to make user interface of application easy so that students play game without hustle. Give points for
          different levels so that those interested already get a fair chance. If possible in future integrate other
          concepts also of Science.

          As a whole All the best for future. âœ¨ðŸ”¥</li><br><br>
        <li>I would say try to relate the applications of Quantum computing to various known fields like Machine Learning, Big Data and Cyber Security and how it has the potential to change the face of Artificial Intelligence.</li><br><br>
        <li> School students after seeing your game:"Replace our history books with quantum games!</li><br><br>
        <li> Make it happen my friends. Good wishes and Good luck to you.</li><br><br>
        <li> Quantum Computing can help us to form more complex games as we can play b/w 0 and 1,while our classical
          computer can 0 and 1. So ,we can make such interesting game in which user have most less probability to win
          that game.</li><br><br>
        <li> The game needs to have levels and be fun with proper scaling and only slight increase in complexity with
          each level.</li>

        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p align="left">Our team consists of three participants: Ashmit JaiSarita Gupta, Divyam Jha and Ankush Verma.
          All of us are Engineering Physics Undergraduate Freshers at NIT Hamirpur. Letâ€™s take a look at our team
          members' backgrounds.
          <br><br>
          Ashmit JaiSarita Gupta is the leader of our team. He belongs to Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh. He has a keen
          interest in the field of Quantum Information Science and Engineering, Data Structures and Game Development.
          Currently, he is learning QC to explore the field. He is working on game design, storyline and its
          implementation through JavaScript and Alan AI.
          <br><br>
          Divyam Jha is a member of our team. He is from Muzaffarpur, Bihar. Some of his major fields of interest
          include Quantum mechanics, Quantum computing and astrophysics.
          Currently, Divyam is also learning QC to enhance his knowledge and apply it in further opportunities. He plans
          to be a physicist in the future. He is contributing to web design, textual and graphical content of the
          website.
          <br><br>
          Ankush Verma is a member of our team. He is from Mandi, Himachal Pradesh. His major fields of interest include
          Quantum computing, Defence services and web development.Currently, he is learning QC and preparing for further
          defence services examinations.He plans to serve the country with his pride and honour. Ankush is working on
          the project website and its implementation.
